    Modpack Permissions & License Info
    You are permitted to redistribute the original Magic Bees mod from the download links in both Public and Private server packs. My implicit permission is granted for all uses.
    Magic Bees is not open source, but I am not going to stop anyone from decompiling it for educational or debugging purposes. I do not provide support for modified versions of the mod.






## not included, but maybe recommended (config file included)

This is a huge problem for me - the best case intuitively is to not share efforts with people who want to be in a community, but feel like they've given enough, so if you aren't already in with them then they don't have time to get back to you, or give you permission to re-use, re-mix. After all, if you already are in FTB, why waste time with the plebes?

Unfortunately in the case of Twilight Forest, there isn't a real replacement. So it's sad. But even though it's frustrating, I'd encourage people to add it given how well thought out and designed it is. 


### TwilightForest

    Please note that I don't usually have the time to respond to mod pack requests (or private messages in general).
    Public mod packs: I am not interested in any more public mod packs at this time. All the packs I'm interested in already have permission.
    Private mod packs: Private server packs are fine. If your mod pack is intended for use on a specific server, and you only distribute it to people playing on that server, go ahead.

### Thaumcraft

http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1585216-thaumcraft-305e-updated-2652013/

Probably won't get permission, because we're not on "the list." Looking for alternatives - it would be better to have a mod that was distributable.

Note this may mean that Thaumic/Magic Bees get yanked.


### RopesPlus 

Permission
 \* mit Zauberkunst, Maschinen und Werkzeuge
